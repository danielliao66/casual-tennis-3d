## Introduction
This project uses Godot 3D engine to create simplified tennis practice game. Since the spin of the ball is taken into account, the trajectory of the ball seems less robotic and more realistic. Players can change horizontal and vertical power as well as the spin type of the ball to have different kinds of strokes.
